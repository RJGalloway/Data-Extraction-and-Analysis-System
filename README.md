## Hardware Required

For cost effectiveness I purchased three Canakits which come with everything you need to set up the Raspberry Pi cluster:

   * pi version 4
   * Micro Sd memory card
   * power supply
   * heatsinks

You can use the included case but I opted for a cluster case by Geek Pi:

## Hardware Setup for Hadoop
For this project there will be three Raspberry Pi version 4 micro computers set up in a cluster. One name node and two data nodes. The following is the process for setting up the Pis headlessly (no need for periphereals, i.e. monitor or keyboard).

**1.** Navigate to [Raspberry Pi OS Installer](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/).

         Download the Raspberry Pi OS installer for your desired OS.
         
         Insert the micro sd card that will be used in your pi into your PC.
         
         From the program menu select the Raspberry Pi OS, then the intended drive
